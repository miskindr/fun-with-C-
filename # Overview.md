# Overview

This is a program of me working on C++ and learning how to use files while learning the basics of C++

The program will create a file of your choosing with the text that you input from the terminal and then display the text
back to you as well as the word count. There is also a math surprise tacked on at the end.

The purpose of this program was to show my understand of python as i raced to learn as much as I could in a 2 week span.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
